				Some experiments in language translation loops, using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/translate/">Google Translate</a> API. The first process copied our revered Bill of Rights, translated it into French, then the result into Chinese, then that result into Spanish, then Afrikaans, Dutch, Czech, Arabic, Japanese, and then back into English. One translation is sure to produce some artifacts -- a chain of translations is certain to amplify them.

				Next, we take the above sequence, and feed it back to the beginning, running the process many more times over again. Iterating the fourth amendment through this feedback loop 20 times, we watch it degenerate to a shell of its former prestige, a not-so-subtle parallel to the real world.
