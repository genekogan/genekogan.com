	<a href="http://www.alongthekarakoram.com">Along the Karakoram</a> is a collaborative audio and visual project with <a href="http://www.gracehzhou.com">Grace Zhou</a> which chronicles the stark beauty of the Karakoram Highway region through found images and sounds. The 1300km route connects the Xinjiang province of East Turkestan / Western China to Gilgit-Baltistan of Northern Pakistan, spanning dozens of languages, cultures, and climates, from the Taklamakan desert to the Hindu Kush mountain range.
