<!description>A visualization of the past 30 years in professional tennis</!description>

<p>
	A visualization of the past 30 years of men's professional tennis, showing the evolution of the top 10 ranked players from December 1982 to September 2012, along with all the winners of the Grand Slam tournaments and Olympics over that time. Weekly rankings were taken from the <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Singles.aspx">ATP Rankings website</a> and winners of the championships were culled from Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.wtatennis.com/">WTA</a> (Women's tennis) does not have the historical rankings available beyond the current ones, so I couldn't do a women's version yet. Hopefully in the future that data will become accessible.
