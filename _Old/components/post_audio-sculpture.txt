<p>
	Audio sculptures fabricated during <a href="http://arthackday.net/">Art Hack Day</a> at <a href="http://319scholes.org/">319 Scholes</a> in January 2012.  The sculpture below is a spectrogram of Billy Joel's <i>Scenes From an Italian Restaurant</i> frozen in time.  Each cross-section of the sculpture, moving upward through time is a representation of the frequency peaks at that moment in the song. It was printed using a <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a> and I also used Marius Watz' <a href="http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/2011/04/06/code-modelbuilder-library-public-release/">Model-building library</a> in Processing.
