<p>
	Mosaic is a program that facilitates the creation of the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic">photo mosaic</a>, a large composition of many small photographs stitched together in such a way as to resemble a single target photograph.
</p>
<p>
	The software was written in Matlab and is designed to take as input a large collection of images, and a single "target image", i.e. the photo which the mosaic should model. It works by dividing the target into a grid, and then fitting individual photographs into each "pixel" within the grid, so as to maximize the overall color similarity between source and target, using an <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ofirpele/FastEMD/code/">implementation</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover's_distance">Earth Mover's distance</a> formula.
</p>
