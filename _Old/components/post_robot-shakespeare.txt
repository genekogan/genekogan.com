<!description>Training a computer to write prose in the style of Shakespeare</!description>

<p>
	An ongoing project to use techniques from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> to create a program which composes prose in the style of William Shakespeare.  This Shakespeare bot first digests the bard's complete works and models it with a word-to-word probability distribution (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">N-grams</a>).
</p>
<p>
	The project is currently under development, and I will be releasing some code soon.  In the meantime, here is a sample from an earlier implementation, trained only on <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.

	<ul>
	<br/>lorenzo even such a night medea gather'd the enchanted herbs that did renew old aeson.
	<br/>launcelot whither goest thou?
	<br/>for truly i think he was able.  i know he will choose it.
	<br/>we'll away to-night and be honourable without the stamp of merit?
	<br/>let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity.
	<br/>o rare fortune, there is more difference between thy flesh and blood to rebel.
	<br/>gratiano you look not well signior antonio commends him to go.
	<br/>then confess and live.
	<br/>launcelot i will have nothing but frown as who should say 'if you will not forfeit it.
	<br/>for if i do not love?
	<br/>shylock hates any man in italy.
	<br/>jessica what must i hold a rival place with one of them i will be bound to him for if i do beseech you let me go.
	<br/>you loved i loved and that no lawful means can carry me out of his state.
	<br/>it must appear that if thou dost shed one drop of blood.
	<br/>still more fool i shall have good inspirations.
	<br/>therefore thou must be something else.
	<br/>shylock why then to thee thou spend'st such high-day wit in an hour.
	<br/>bid them prepare for dinner.
	<br/>what's the news from genoa?
	<br/>hast thou got?
	<br/>thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice.
	<br/>portia is it true salerio?
	<br/>have all persuaded with him at his request.
	<br/>antonio no more pertains to me.
	<br/>fair jessica shall be made.
	<br/>morocco the first of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will answer all things faithfully.
	<br/>gratiano you must take your place.
	<br/>but let it presage the ruin of the ring.
	<br/>for your wish and am well pleased to give you little thanks for that which one unworthier may attain and die with grieving.
	<br/>i saw bassanio under sail and gone to-night.
	<br/>portia i did dream of money-bags to-night.
	</ul>
